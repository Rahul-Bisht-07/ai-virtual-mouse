# AI Virtual Mouse üñ±Ô∏èü§ñ

This project implements a real-time AI-powered virtual mouse using hand gestures. It utilizes computer vision and deep learning libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the cursor, perform clicks, scroll, and adjust volume using hand gestures.

## ‚ú® Features
- Move the mouse with your index finger
- Left-click by pinching index and middle fingers
- Scroll using index and thumb pinch
- Adjust system volume using pinch intensity
- Pause cursor movement with full palm gesture

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- AutoPy
- Pycaw (for volume control)
